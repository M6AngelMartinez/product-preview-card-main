## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- BEM
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

In this project, I reinforced my use of Flexbox to create responsive and flexible layouts. I also learned how to use `gap` for clean spacing, `hover` with `transition` for better user experience, and media queries to adapt the design to mobile devices.


### Continued development

- Practice using CSS variables
- Improve web accessibility (ARIA labels, roles, contrast)
- Explore frameworks like Tailwind CSS
- Enhance my project structure for a more professional look
